'''
Determines whether a point is in a polygon. Code adopted
from the C program in Graphics Gems IV by Haines (1994).

Change history
    October 9, 2018
        All points on edge are counted as in

    October 10, 2017
        Use generic Python exception

    September 2017
        Python 3

    December 2016
        Add pip_cross2, which also works for complicated polygons
        with multiple parts or holes

    October 2016
        Removed function pip_cross0
        Changed <> to !=
        Raise error if polygon is not closed (previous version modifies data)
            This requires polygon_error.py.
        Changed some variable names for better read

   October 2015
        A bug in previous code, pip_cross0, is fixed.
